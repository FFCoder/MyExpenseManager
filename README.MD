# My Budget Manager
I am working on this platform as a way to help me better manager my finances. The best tool I have found so far has been YNAB. However I am not a fan of the subscription model. 

## Goals
- [ ] Create a budgeting platform that is easy to use and understand
- [ ] Create a platform that is easy to deploy
- [ ] Create a platform that is easy to maintain
- [ ] Create a platform that is easy to extend
  - [ ] I want to be able to add new features easily
- [ ] Create a platform that is free to use
- [ ] Create a platform that manages my finances better than I can
- [ ] Create a platform that ensures I am not spending more than I make (Very important)

## Initial Deadline
I want to have a working prototype by the end of July 2023.
